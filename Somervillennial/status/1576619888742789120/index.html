  	      Crossing Beech St at the Mass Ave intersection sucks. Walk signal was active, but a line of cars was still turning left from Mass Ave as I was in the crosswalk. Managed to stop the last driver; I pointed at the walk signal and he shouted at me to "watch the light" ðŸ¤¨ <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1576618055412551680-FeFFw_pWAAI3WSf.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1576618055412551680-FeFFw_pWAAI3WSf.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>

  	      Assuming the drivers weren't running a red (still possible!), I do not think it is safe for the walk signal to be active while they southbound lane has a green. This is a major thruway and drivers think a green absolves them of the need to look out for non-drivers.
