  	      I don't know if it's good or bad that I didn't hear about "reimagining" police, but there was a lot of talk about recruitment that suggests a vision for increased staffing.

  	      Candidate Murphy seemed open to re-evaluating how the role of police in responding to emergency calls, but that was as close as we got to a discussion on AER. All interviews apparently happened in a void where the Civilian Oversight and Public Safety task forces don't exist.

  	      Candidate Jenkins was explicit that his perception of the police growing up (citing the Rodney King beatings) influenced his decision to join the force and make something better. I was hoping to hear this lead to a conversation about needing LESS policing though...

  	      Candidate Vivolo did not speak as much as the others and I didn't get a good sense of his vision for the department. As a current SPD officer, maybe it's status quo.

  	      Overall, I would have liked to see the hiring committee ask candidates how they would have responded to any number of issues the city has seen over the years. That would have been more meaningful to me than hearing about how the youth need positive interaction with the police...
