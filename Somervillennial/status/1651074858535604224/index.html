  	      I attended last fall's Ward 3 meeting and I often went to these when they used to be called "ResiStat". FWIW I think they work best as a way to connect with electeds and city staff in attendance; there usually isn't any much breaking news in the presentation.<br><br>2/x

  	      In other words, this audience does not represent Somerville; I'm guessing it doesn't even represent Ward 3. I could guess a few reasons why the current meeting model is out-of-date. Maybe the virtual and language-specific ward meetings will draw a more diverse crowd.<br><br>6/x

  	      And that's it. IMO there were glimpses of more substantial resident/city conversation there, but this space doesn't always work well for it. I think the beginning/end of the meeting is a little more interesting anyway -- stick around and talk with city staff/electeds!<br><br>55/55
