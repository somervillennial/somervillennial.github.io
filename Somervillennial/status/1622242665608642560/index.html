  	      This will wreck the commute of anyone who parks at the garage or catches shuttles that service Rt128, so it bewilders me when media/authorities describe it in a way that ignores that (1) the car didn't just crash on its own and (2) Alewife has been in bad shape for years. <a href="https://twitter.com/MBTA/status/1622005081846464514">https://twitter.com/MBTA/status/1622005081846464514</a> <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1622242663129878533-FoNdGqlXgAA_Zi9.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1622242663129878533-FoNdGqlXgAA_Zi9.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>

  	      The second point is something I noticed over years of outbound commuting via Alewife. Was any of the damage amplified by aged infrastructure? How does this relate to the ongoing garage repairs that began five (!) years ago in 2018?<br><br><a href="https://www.mbta.com/projects/alewife-garage-repairs">https://www.mbta.com/projects/alewife-garage-repairs</a>

  	      These two points should be looked at together. Transit police claim this was "intentional" but also the driver was found unconscious -- even if we assume mistake or medical emergency, how can a garage be constructed to prevent this damage/disruption?<br><br><a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/alewife-station-parking-garage-crash-car-on-edge/42765261">https://www.wcvb.com/article/alewife-station-parking-garage-crash-car-on-edge/42765261</a>
