  	      Clean Sky Energy reps are in my neighborhood (Spring Hill), asking for utilities account info. (Last year there was Clearway Community Solar.) Someone in my apt complex must have let them in, as they were going door to door. How is this stuff legal? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/jcji3l/psa_residents_energy_is_out_knocking_on_doors/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/jcji3l/psa_residents_energy_is_out_knocking_on_doors/</a>

  	      Like, the phrasing from the rep is not "We'd like to offer you a different supplier source", it was "I need to see your most recent utility bill so I can get the account information." This is predatory! Folks assume they are affiliated with the utility provider!

  	      Years ago, I was fooled by one of these reps -- it wasn't really a conversation, more like I was being told what to do. Luckily I realized the mistake afterward, called their service line, and cancelled.
