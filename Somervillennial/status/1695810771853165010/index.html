  	      BPS parents' concern for their children's safety is real and understandable, but this opinion piece does not consider what happens to the wellbeing of students when they are routinely viewed by police as a security threat. <a href="https://twitter.com/GlobeOpinion/status/1693728673453551975">https://twitter.com/GlobeOpinion/status/1693728673453551975</a> <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1695810769563091097-F4i66GSXYAAUeod.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1695810769563091097-F4i66GSXYAAUeod.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>

  	      I think it's fair to say Boston schools have more to deal with than Somerville's, but IMO you can never police your way to the solution. This is a reactive policy. <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1695810777851072776-F4i66k3WgAErihn.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1695810777851072776-F4i66k3WgAErihn.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>
